# ONLINE_STORE_STARTUP_PROJECT_DBMS

Project Online store Startup
Consider that you have got an internship in an upcoming unicorn startup. The organisation wants to create an online survey feature for the different categories of the products sold by them to help with their business intelligence and make out useful strategies to improve.
Now, you are given the very first task which is to design a database schema for this scenario to store the necessary data.
Few of the requirements for the survey are as follows:
1. The survey can be reused to get feedback for multiple products. It would contain the ratings given by the buyer.


2. A customer is the registered user to whom the shopping account belongs. A customer will take up a survey when he/she will purchase a product.


3. A survey will have multiple questions. These questions are selected from a large dataset containing different types of questions.The questions can be subjective as well as objective types of questions.


4. Customers and buyers(the customers who have made a purchase) are stored separately.


5. Buyers have to answer the questions given in the feedback, some of which are mandatory and some are optional. These answers should also be stored separately so that analysis can be done on all the answers received till date for the products.


6. It should have all the details of the customer and the product bought with itâ€™s feedback.


Now keeping the above information in mind, design the Survey database schema by answering the following questions step by step:


1. Identify the entities


2. Identify the attributes for various entities.


3. Identify the relationships with the cardinalities.


4. Create the ER diagram


5. Create the Relational schema.
